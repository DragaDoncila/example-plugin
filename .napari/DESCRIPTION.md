This is my napari-hub specific description. It is detailed, and comprehensive (v0.0.4) - extra comprehension.

I'm changing this description to test my plugin preview.

This is a description edited in a fork of the main repo, after installing the napari hub plugin preview app.

Just checking whether this commit will wake the napari-hub-bot up.

Checking if updating permissions wakes up the bot?

Changing after pointing to feature branch.
